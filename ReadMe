Morala's Dice
-------------------------
-------------------------

This is Morala's Dice it is a game like 21 just with dice.

1) When you start the server it will start listening for clients.
2) Afterwards when you start a new client host you you will be prompted by the server to provide a name.
3) Once you type your name and hit enter the server will ask you to ready up (you can do so by typing 'r' and pressing enter)
4) The above will need to happen for every user on the server before the game will start.
5) Once everyone has readied instructions will pop up explaining how to play the game.
6) Basically the goal is to get as close as you can to 21 without going over.
7) You can either type 'h' or 's' to perform an action
    -Typing 'h' and pressing enter will let you "HIT" meaning you roll 2 six sided dice and their total is added to your score
    -Typing 's' and pressing enter will make you "STAY" meaning you stop rolling
8) After all players have stayed or someone busts (goes over 21) the game will decide based on your scores who is the winner.
9) Afterwards the game is over and a new game will automatically start.

NOTES: New users cannot join when a game that has already started.
       Also the server must be restarted when a user leaves (ERROR will pop up when user leaves).
